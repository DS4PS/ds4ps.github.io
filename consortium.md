 ## Overview 
 
Schools of public affairs are increasingly incorporating data science into their curricula to meet the demand for these skills in the workforce. The public and nonprofit sectors seek graduates with the ability to both manage and deploy the large volumes of data generated by public sector activities. Additionally, students outside of public affairs are interested in opportunities to develop technological solutions to social problems in contexts that value a social science toolkit as an essential component of durable solutions. 

The DS4PS Consortium is an effort to bring together schools of public affairs to build a community of data science professionals and identify opportunities for improving educational opportunities and career pathways within our field.
