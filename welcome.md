## New to Data Science? 

Welcome to the "[sexiest career of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)". This page contains some resources to help you learn about the field.

## The Open Source Ecosystem

Open source tools and data programming languages have evolved rapidly and are quickly becoming industry standard for data scientists. 

The R community has taken this to another scale. There are currently 13,000 free and open-source packages available in R. It is better to think about R as an operating system, and the contributed packages as the programs you use for specific tasks.

In addition to packages created for R, there are also powerful tools that make it easier to share data, collaborate on work, and share your results in creative ways. One of the reasons R has become an industry favorite is that it is highly integrated into this ecosystem. Many of these tools are built-right into R Studio, making it easier to manage large projects or collaborate.

Public Affairs programs are adopting these technologies because they are free and powerful. A single data programming language like R can perform statistical analysis, dynamic reporting, GIS, analysis for qualitative research, and other functions, meaning it can be substituted for several expensive software licenses, making it a good choice for public sector and nonprofit organizations that don't have large technology budgets.

It also lends itself to open innovation since analytical solutions to public sector problems can be easily shared and adopted across localities to encourage collaboration and support an ecosystem of performance.

There is a non-trivial learning curve to master some of the tools, but the good news is that there are now plenty of good resources.

## Getting Started

Working in the field of data science requires a data programming language. R and Python are the two most common languages you will encounter. Typically if come from the field of computer science you are likely a Python programmer, and if you come from the social sciences, statistics, or engineering yoU typically use R. There are pros and cons to each, but both are powerful and flexible. This site will emphasize R-based approaches for expertise reasons only, but Python-based applications are common in the public sector as well.
